Which of the following is an AWS Cloud architecture design principle?

Implement single points of failure.
Implement loose coupling.
Implement monolithic design.
Implement vertical scaling.

Correct answer:
Implement loose coupling.

Explanation:
Loose coupling between services can also be done through asynchronous integration. 
It involves one component that generates events and another that consumes them. 
The two components do not integrate through direct point-to-point interaction, 
but usually through an intermediate durable storage layer. 
This approach decouples the two components and introduces additional resiliency. 
So, for example, if a process that is reading messages from the queue fails,
 messages can still be added to the queue to be processed when the system recovers.

A metrics repository with customizable notification thresholds and channels.
Explaination:
Explanation:
Amazon CloudWatch is basically a metrics repository. 
An AWS service — such as Amazon EC2 — puts metrics into the repository, 
and you retrieve statistics based on those metrics. If you put your own custom metrics into the repository, 
you can retrieve statistics on these metrics as well.

Amazon S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and low-cost storage class of S3 for data archiving and long-term backup. Customers can store large or small amounts of data for as little as $0.004 per gigabyte per month. The S3 Glacier storage class is ideal for archives where data is regularly retrieved and some of the data may be needed in minutes.

Amazon RDS is a relational database service that hosts databases. It helps you create and manage databases. Amazon Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transfer service that provides cost efficient data transfer to AWS from tamper proof physical devices. Similarly, Elastic block storage offers persistent block storage volumes for EC2 instances.

As for using largest instance possible, it is not a design principle that helps cloud applications in anyway. Scrum development process is not related to architecting. Therefore, a key principle is to provision your application for on-demand capacity. Peak loads is something that cloud applications experience everyday. Peak load management should be a necessary part of cloud application design principle.

Amazon Route 53
Security Groups
Subnets
Elastic Load Balancing


Correct answer:
Security Groups
Subnets
Explaination:
Explanation:
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section
 of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. 
 You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection 
 of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.
 You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 in your VPC for secure and easy access to resources and applications.
You can easily customize the network configuration for your Amazon VPC. 
For example, you can create a public-facing subnet for your web servers that has access to the Internet, 
and place your backend systems such as databases or application servers 
in a private-facing subnet with no Internet access. You can leverage multiple layers of security,
 including security groups and network access control lists, to help control access to Amazon EC2 instances in each subnet.

reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).
increased capital expenditure (capex).
reduced operational expenditure (opex).
deferred payment plans for startups.
business credit lines for stratups.

Correct answer:
reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).
increased capital expenditure (capex).
Explaination:
Explanation:
A core reason organizations adopt a cloud IT infrastructure is to save money. The traditional approach of analyzing Total Cost of Ownership no longer applies when you move to the cloud. Cloud services provide the opportunity for you to use only what you need and pay only for what you use. We refer to this new paradigm as the Total Cost of Operation. You can use Total Cost of Operation (TCO) analysis methodologies to compare the costs of owning a traditional data center with the costs of operating your environment using AWS Cloud services.

A pay-as-you-go model reduces investments in large capital expenditures. In addition, you can reduce the operating expense (OpEx) costs involved with the management and maintenance of data. This frees up budget, allowing you to quickly act on innovative initiatives that can’t be easily pursued when managing CapEx.

Correct answer:
Apply an IAM policy to an IAM group.
Explaination:
Explanation:
Instead of defining permissions for individual IAM users, it's usually more convenient to create groups that relate to job functions (administrators, developers, accounting, etc.). Next, define the relevant permissions for each group. Finally, assign IAM users to those groups. All the users in an IAM group inherit the permissions assigned to the group. That way, you can make changes for everyone in a group in just one place. As people move around in your company, you can simply change what IAM group their IAM user belongs to.

Which of the following security measures protect access to an AWS account? (Choose two.)

Enable AWS CloudTrail.
Grant least privilege access to IAM users.
Create one IAM user and share with many developers and users.
Enable Amazon CloudFront.
Activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged users.


Correct answer:
Grant least privilege access to IAM users.
Activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged users.
Explaination:
Explanation:
If you decided to create service accounts (that is, accounts used for programmatic access by applications running outside of the AWS environment) and generate access keys for them, you should create a dedicated service account for each use case. This will allow you to restrict the associated policy to only the permissions needed for the particular use case, limiting the blast radius if the credentials are compromised. For example, if a monitoring tool and a release management tool both require access to your AWS environment, create two separate service accounts with two separate policies that define the minimum set of permissions for each tool.

Which AWS service provides a simple and scalable shared file storage solution for use with Linux-based AWS and on-premises servers

Amazon S3
Amazon Glacier
Amazon EBS
Amazon EFS

Correct answer:
Amazon EFS
Explaination:
Explanation:
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, 
fully managed elastic NFS file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. 
It is built to scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications, 
growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, eliminating the need to provision and manage capacity to accommodate growth.

Amazon EFS is designed to provide the throughput, IOPS, and low latency needed for Linux workloads. 
Throughput and IOPS scale as a file system grows and can burst to higher throughput 
levels for short periods of time to support the unpredictable performance needs of file workloads.
For the most demanding workloads, Amazon EFS can support performance over 10 GB/sec and up to 500,000 IOPS.

Amazon Direct 


Correct answer:
Amazon Direct Connect
Explaination:
Explanation:
AWS Direct Connect enables you to securely connect your AWS environment to your on-premises data center or office location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic connection. AWS Direct Connect offers dedicated high speed, low latency connection, which bypasses internet service providers in your network path. An AWS Direct Connect location provides access to Amazon Web Services in the region it is associated with, as well as access to other US regions. AWS Direct Connect allows you to logically partition the fiber-optic connections into multiple logical connections called Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN). You can take advantage of these logical connections to improve security, differentiate traffic, and achieve compliance requirements.
